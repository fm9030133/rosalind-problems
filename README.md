These are my solutions to the bioinformatics problems on Rosalind.info

I intend this project to develop my job-ready skills while creating a presentable portfolio for possible collaborators.
I am currently working towards a BS in Physics to train in computational modelling. Simultaneously I am translating these skills into the bioinformatics field. This knowledge of scientific first principles gives me insight into the what is basically possible in the field of bioinformatics.

If you are interested in hiring me please do not hesitate to contact me.
