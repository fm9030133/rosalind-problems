These are my solutions to the bioinformatics problems on Rosalind.info

This project develops my job-ready skills while creating a portfolio for possible collaborators.

I am currently working towards a BS in Physics to train in general computational modelling. I hope to translate these skills into the bioinformatics field. This knowledge of scientific first-principles gives me insight into the what is basically possible in the field of bioinformatics.
